# Preface {-}

Welcome to the 2nd edition of R Packages! If you're familiar with the 1st edition, this preface describes the major changes so that you can focus your reading on the new areas.

There are X main goals for this edition:

* Update to reflect changes in the devtools package, specifically, its ["conscious uncoupling"](https://www.tidyverse.org/articles/2018/10/devtools-2-0-0/#conscious-uncoupling) into a set of smaller, more focused packages.

* Expanded coverage of workflow and process, alongside the presentation of all the important moving parts that make up an R package.
  
* *more to come*
  
Specifics about individual chapters:

* New chapter \@ref(whole-game), "The Whole Game", previews key steps in the package development process.

* New chapter \@ref(setup), "Setup", has been carved out of the previous Introduction and gained more detail.

* The sections "Organising your functions" and "Code style", from Chapter \@ref(r), "R code", have been removed, in favor of an online style guide, <https://style.tidyverse.org/>. The style guide is paired with the new styler package [@styler] which can automatically apply many of the rules.

* The chapter formerly known as "Package structure" has been expanded and split into two chapters, one covering package structure and state (Chapter \@ref(package-structure-state)) and another on workflows and tooling (Chapter \@ref(workflows101)).

* *something about git/github*
